	<p class="body">Prior to college, I introduced myself using my full Chinese name, Tairan, which means <a href="https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=tairan" target="_blank">&ldquo;calm and composed&rdquo;</a> in Mandarin. A friend from freshman year started calling me Tai, and it has since had the profound effect of transforming my name from something that is butchered on a weekly basis to one that is just occasionally misspelled.</p>

	<p class="body">I grew up in China and, like our pilgrim fathers, settled in New England. I spent my formative years there and ultimately graduated from Cornell University with an AB in <a href="http://infosci.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Information Science.</a> Afterwards, I spent seven years in the wintry suburbs of Chicago, where I learned to hate snow. I currently live in sunny Los Angeles with <a href="https://twitter.com/minpark" target="_blank">my wife</a>.</p>

	<p class="body">Like most college grads who didn&rsquo;t want to be poor, I took a lucrative corporate job at an industrial supply company in a rotational management track. In this former life, I&rsquo;ve managed and delivered several successful software projects, served as art director for a nearly 4,000 page catalog, managed a warehouse operation responsible for over 10,000 orders a day, and headed a finance department that deals with many, many more zeros. It was a stable and comfortable living, and I learned many aspects of how to run an incredibly successful business.</p>

	<p class="body">However, aside from rare moments, work was rarely a source of passion. It was the definition of &ldquo;working to live,&rdquo; and I found it increasingly difficult to justify spending half of my day doing something I wasn&rsquo;t enthusiastic about in return for a steady uptick in my savings account. It was time for a change, and in the beginning of 2014, I finally stepped off of the hamster wheel.</p>

	<p class="body">I am currently enjoying a sabbatical and taking the opportunity to learn voraciously, explore creative endeavors, get back in shape, read, travel, and generally reset. However, I&rsquo;m open to the right opportunity should it come along, and I would be particularly excited about any roles in product management or design for a company doing interesting, ambitious work. If you feel like I&rsquo;d be a good fit for a role you have in mind, <a href="mailto:tai@dekaliber.net">I&rsquo;d love to hear from you</a>.</p>

	<p class="body">Since I was young I have always loved the process of creating. I have been building websites since 2001 (though, if I&rsquo;m honest, the first few years probably weren&rsquo;t very good). In my youth, I would invent board games and create levels for video games. Before I got involved with computer graphics, I spent a lot of time drawing despite the fact that my parents regarded it as a poor way to advance their ambitions for me to become a doctor or lawyer.</p>

	<p class="body">I try often to indulge in my other semi-serious pursuits, which are <a title="My photo portfolio" href="http://www.dekaliber.net/photo" target="_blank">photography</a>, <a title="My Last.fm page" href="http://www.last.fm/user/dekaliber" target="_blank">music</a>, <a title="My Yelp profile" href="http://taiz.yelp.com" target="_blank">food</a>, and <a title="A few shots from a track day" href="https://www.facebook.com/tai.zhang.581/media_set?set=a.10100107054518685.2532923.403730&amp;type=3" target="_blank">motorsports</a>. I also love a great film, and while I am especially receptive to post-apocalyptic/dystopian sci-fi or historical epics featuring ample hand-to-hand combat, I am generally happy to watch anything with a decent score on <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes.</a></p>
