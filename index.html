	<p>Hello, I&rsquo;m Tai. I am a creative who loves minimalist, user-centered design, a front-end developer who loves bringing ideas to life through code, and a business-minded problem solver who gets the big picture. My passion is working with interesting people on innovative ideas at the intersection of business, technology, and design. <a href="about">Curious about more?</a></p>

				<p class="body">After filling out job applications through a dozen or so different applicant tracking systems such as Jobvite, Taleo, BrassRing, etc., I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that not enough thought has been given to the applicant&rsquo;s experience in the design of these systems. I can&rsquo;t speak to how well these work for recruiters, but here were a few common frustrations I experienced as a job-seeker. Some of these often exist throughout web forms in general:</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>System-centric rather than user-centric form fields (e.g. Address Line 1, Address Line 2)</li>
					<li>Clumsy handling of required fields</li>
					<li>Need to create an account before being able to make progress</li>
					<li>Inclusion of secondary information or optional fields resulting in visual clutter</li>
					<li>Lack of assuring feedback after uploading supporting documents</li>
					<li>Poor information layout (or, sometimes, just really ugly)</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body">As this often represents a company&rsquo;s first interaction with potential employees, both parties stand to benefit from a seamless experience here. Since there&rsquo;s no point in complaining about something without trying to make it better, I <a href="work/jobapplication/">took a stab</a> at creating a more thoughtful form and included my rationale.</p>

				<p class="body">Biddenly, an apartment rental start-up in San Francisco, fired an <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/05/ugly-craigslist-ads/" target="_blank">important first volley</a> last year by <a href="http://www.biddenly.com/example/" target="_blank">re-imagining</a> the ubiquitous Craigslist housing posting. I worked with one of the founders to help launch the real estate division. It was my responsibility to envision what a for-sale listing might look like by applying the same fundamental principles of clean, informative design and to develop a minimum viable prototype to gather feedback with realtors and customers.</p>

					<h3>Objectives</h3>
					<p class="body">Anyone who has ever shopped for a home with a realtor has suffered through the barely comprehensible data dump that is the <a href="http://www.saveonmls.com/sample_mls_listing.htm" target="_blank">MLS listing.</a> Our goal for the design was to dramatically improve the user experience by presenting a clearly structured interface that captures what the ideal home sales listing might look like. Despite the density of information that home listings entail, the design should still feel clean and minimal, with the most important facts presented first.</p>

					</div><div class="col2_3">
						<h3>Design for Mobile First</h3>
						<p class="body">We expected that as many people would use this tool on their phones while touring a home as those who would be researching them on their laptops at home. With a mobile-first approach in mind, the full-sized version is responsive down to 640 pixels wide, and on mobile devices a version optimized for smaller multi-touch screens takes over without compromising the design.</p>

						<h3>Present the Right Information at the Right Time</h3>
						<p class="body">The landing screen should quickly allow users to decide whether to explore further or move on -- Can I afford it? Is it big enough for my family? What does it look like, inside and out? Less important details are collapsed in the default view to draw emphasis to the ones that are more likely relevant -- e.g. information about the basement is usually more important than the attic, the parking structure and number of spaces matters more than the driveway material.</p>

						<h3>Provide Multiple Entry Points</h3>
						<p class="body">Calls to action on the initial view invite the user to explore more pictures or get in touch with the seller. Nearly every element in this view is clickable and reveals additional detail by linking to another section of the page. Under Home Details, School and WalkScore information serve as entry points to more information. Floorplans within each room allow easy navigation to other parts of the tour.</p>

						<h3>Simulate the Real World Experience</h3>
						<p class="body">We wanted the presentation to capture the experience of <em>physically</em> touring a home. Features and selling points can be described on a room-by-room level, and we envisioned a way for sellers to add a rough floorplan by creating draggable shapes for any rooms that have dimensional information. The design emphasizes relative size and location without burdening users with excessive detail.</p>

				<p class="body">Most social networking platforms are designed to help existing friends connect. Considerable thought goes into presenting and filtering content to maintain a profile appropriate for an audience made up of friends, family, and coworkers, often obscuring our genuine selves. The concept of Unanimo.us hinges on the theory that engaging people with insightful questions, rather than the image they choose to present, tells a better story about who they really are. In doing so, it aims to create new type of social network that helps like-minded strangers connect.</p>

					<h3>Defining the Problem</h3>
					<p class="body">Meeting new friends can be challenging during our adult lives. Compared to our formative years, we meet fewer new people on a regular basis, and the likelihood of becoming close with these people is even further reduced as a result of disparities in age, lifestyle, and background. As social circles shrink due to relocation, marriage, and other life changes, the prospect of making close friends often diminish dramatically. How can technology solve this problem?</p>

					<h3>The Concept</h3>
					<p class="body">The crux of this project is to provide a new way to answer the question &ldquo;I wonder who else is like me?&rdquo; At its core, it aims to create an engaging platform that utilizes anonymity to encourage honest responses to user-submitted questions. In a way, the site will become an organically evolving &ldquo;personality test&rdquo; with content that is upvoted and moderated by the community. Users will be anonymous with no names or photos, and their profile will show the questions they&rsquo;ve answered and where they fall along various personality metrics. An initial set of basic functionality will allow users to find and contact like-minded people in their area.</p>

				<p class="body">The process started from a few simple sketches on paper that were then transferred to wireframes in Fireworks. These were initially stitched together to create a simple interactive flow using <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">Invision.</a> While this proved to be a great start without much upfront cost, the limitations of the software resulted in a great deal of redundant effort when it became necessary to make changes or show diverging flows. Rather than continuing to refine static mockups, it made more sense to move directly to building an HTML prototype early in the process using CSS3 flexbox to rapidly lay out content. Browser support is currently limited as a result, but the intent so far is to have designs that can be shown in a controlled environment.</p>

	<h1>Older Work</h1>
	<p class="body">For the sake of continuity, much of my previous work can be found on my now rather ancient and outmoded <a href="old/" target="_blank">Flash portfolio</a> (circa late 2004, yikes). It was my first Flash project and, I&rsquo;ll admit, created with far more emphasis on flair than usability. Needless to say, it now represents quite a departure from modern norms. Fortunately, both technology as well as my design sensibilities have evolved significantly since then.</p>
